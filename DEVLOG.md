## :books: Development Log:

### January 8:

- Initiated blank TypeScript Expo project
- Followed a [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hln37dE19bs&ab_channel=BenAwad) to set up the basic navigation for the app
  - Created a stack navigation for the `login` and `register` screens
  - Launch this stack on app loaded
  - Created a basic authorization provider to know which user is logged in to use on every screen
- Created a custom TypeScript functional component snippet

### January 16:

- Display loading screen while seeing if a user is logged in
  - if a user is logged in, stop loading and display the main app
  - is a user does not exist, stop loading and display login/register screen
- Added bottom tab navigation screens
- Created custom header for bottom tab screens
- Created a navigation stack for the home tab, showing the feed and then listing details

### January 24:

- Created a stack navigation for messages screen, removed stack navigator for home feed.
- Create Listing Detail page, link it to one of the items in the list on the feed such that when the list item is clicked, we are taken to a new screen
  - linked through passing in the name through the route's props.. do be changed when real data is present
- READDED IN Home Stack Navigator... realized I needed it afterall :/
- Changed AppTabs to not show header, and made the tabs show a custom header themselves

Process for creating a Stack Navigator in TS:
  - Create file for the stack navigator
    - create a stack navigator object
    - create a functional component that returns the stack navigator, with the necessary stack screens nested inside
    - this file contains the "directions" for the stack - ie. what component to render for each screen
  - Create a file for the types, for each screen in the stack
    - define a new type, a ParamList, that indicates that each screen's type is undefined
    - then, since we need the navigation prop in each screen, create a NavProp type that can be customized with the name of the screen
    - this is your types file, so you always have the navigation prop in your screen and you always have the screen name correct
  - Create your screens to render
  - Return the Stack Navigator in a parent file

### January 30:

- Created the Button component, with primary and secondary buttons
- Created ListingCard component, with optional appearance of edit button
  - On click, brings you to the listing details page for the listing

### February 5:
- Fixed a horrible, confusing bug by reverting to an old commit, and recreating the necessary files
- Created TextInput component

### Next Up:

- make components
- learn how to make modals
- add real data into feed list
